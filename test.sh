# You should also include a simple test script that initializes the server and then starts a few clients (e.g., 10)
# that perform some writes and reads (e.g., 10K). The script then must print the following stats on the console:
# server start time, #total_sets done, #total_gets done, #total_getprefixes done. Finally, the script must stop the server.
